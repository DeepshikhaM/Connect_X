# # 🏆 ConnectX Reinforcement Learning Agent

## 📌 Project Description  
Developing a reinforcement learning agent to play **ConnectX**, a strategic game where players drop checkers into a grid, aiming to align a specific number in a row before the opponent. The project involves training an AI model to optimize moves using **reinforcement learning**, ensuring competitive gameplay against other agents.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Traditional machine learning competitions focus on supervised learning, but reinforcement learning (RL) presents a new challenge—**decision-making through self-play and adaptive learning**. This project explores RL methodologies to build an intelligent agent that competes in a **multi-agent, evolving environment**, learning optimal strategies through continuous gameplay.

## 📂 Dataset & Files  
- `train.csv` - Training dataset  
- `test.csv` - Test dataset  
- `sample_submission.csv` - Sample submission file  
- `metaData.csv` - Supplementary information about dataset features  

## 🏗 Project Steps  
1. **Environment Understanding**: Define game rules, state representation, and action space.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare and structure datasets for training.  
3. **Agent Development**: Implement RL techniques such as **Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), or Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**.  
4. **Training & Optimization**: Improve model strategies through self-play and reward-based learning.  
5. **Evaluation & Leaderboard Ranking**: Compete against other players, refine performance based on **skill rating μ**.  

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics  
The performance is not judged by accuracy but rather by **relative ranking** in the competition.  
- A **Gaussian-based skill rating system (μ, σ²)** estimates an agent's ability.  
- Winning matches **increase μ**, while losses decrease it.  
- The leaderboard dynamically adjusts based on match outcomes.  

## ⚡ Challenges & Enhancements  
- Handling **exploration vs. exploitation** trade-offs.  
- Adapting to **dynamic strategies** from other competing agents.  
- Optimizing **computation efficiency** for fast decision-making.  
- Experimenting with **different RL architectures** for optimal performance.  

## 📌 Future Scope  
- Expanding agent capabilities to handle **different board sizes** and rule variations.  
- Integrating **transfer learning** to apply strategies across different reinforcement learning tasks.  
- Developing an **explainable AI (XAI) model** to interpret agent decisions.

### ✅ How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ConnectX.git
   cd ConnectX


from kaggle_environments import make

# Setup a tictactoe environment.
env = make("tictactoe")

# Basic agent which marks the first available cell.
def my_agent(obs):
  return [c for c in range(len(obs.board)) if obs.board[c] == 0][0]

# Run the basic agent against a default agent which chooses a "random" move.
env.run([my_agent, "random"])

# Render an html ipython replay of the tictactoe game.
env.render(mode="ipython")
