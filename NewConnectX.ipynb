The 0.0 score highlights a significant difficulty for the Enhanced PPO Agent in competing with this advanced algorithm, possibly due to inadequate training or mismatched strategy."

    "\n",
    "- PPO's policy-gradient-based approach allows it to learn more robust and dynamic strategies, which outperformed the Q-learning-based DQN and Double DQN agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The continuous updates and clipping in PPO ensure stable policy improvements, reducing overfitting to specific scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Against Random Agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A positive average reward against the random agent shows the PPO agent has learned effective gameplay strategies, consistently outperforming a naive opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Against Negamax Agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Achieving a comparable average reward against the Negamax agent (a heuristic-based opponent) demonstrates that the PPO agent has developed strategic decision-making capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison with DQN and Double DQN:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DQN and Double DQN agents generally rely on value-based methods, which may struggle with complex state-action spaces like ConnectX.\n",
    "PPO’s policy-gradient methods provide an advantage by directly optimizing actions based on expected rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- The Enhanced PPO Agent demonstrates superior performance in ConnectX, outperforming Q-learning-based methods and showcasing its potential for solving complex, sequential decision-making problems. It is a promising candidate for further optimization and deployment in competitive ConnectX environments."
